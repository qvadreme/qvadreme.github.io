Something that's easy to get wrong is making sure Pushes are actually in a straight line, particularly when models are base-to-base.

Suppose you've got Ox and Midas base-to-base.

![Ox and Midas][ox-and-midas]

Ox wants to bring Midas further into the rest of the Butchers team, so with his attack he takes the Push. He wants Midas engaged by Boiler and Princess - where can he actually Push Midas?

Not where he wants. Because Midas has to travel in a straight line, he can't cross the common tangent line through where the two bases meet - otherwise he'd go through Ox's base. In the same way, if Ox was KD and Midas declared a Charge on Boiler or Princess, he couldn't cross the tangent line, so couldn't actually reach. That means that Midas can only end up in the green part of the pitch and not in the red part.

![Ox and Midas 2][ox-and-midas-end]

When Midas suffers a 2" Push into the green part of the pitch, the path is clear and he's definitely not going over Ox's base.

![Ox and Midas 3][ox-and-midas-good]

If Midas were able to be pushed into the red part of the pitch, he'd have to end up passing over Ox's base, which he can't do!
