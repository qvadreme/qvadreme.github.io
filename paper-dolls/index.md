title: Season 2 Paper Dolls
layout: page

Steamforged provided some very useful Paper Dolls for trying out the Season 1 models before buying them. They're still available from the [Steamforged Resources section][official-pd].

They didn't do any Paper Dolls for Season 2, but I've started to make some unofficial ones. [I put them up on Dropbox][my-pd].

There are some much more printer-friendly (and actually up-to-date) Paper Dolls [from RedSam][redsam-pd].
